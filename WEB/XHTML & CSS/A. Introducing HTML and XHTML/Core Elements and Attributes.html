<p> This    paragraph shows        how multiple spaces between words are
treated as a single space. This is known as white space collapsing, and
the big spaces    between some of     the words will not appear in the
browser.
It also demonstrates how the browser will treat multiple carriage returns
(new lines) as a single space, too. </p>
