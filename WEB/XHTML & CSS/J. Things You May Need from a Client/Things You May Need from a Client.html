Things You May Need from a Client
========================================================================================================
When working on a site for a client, you should ask for the followingbefore starting to design the site:

[•] An electronic copy of the company logo

[•] Branding guidelines (if the client has them), which will include things such as the company’ s
    color scheme, choice of typefaces, and other rules to help ensure that information representing
    the brand has a cohesive appearance

[•] Copies of brochures or leaflets that they have done (particularly if they do not have branding
     guidelines)

[•] Materials the client supposed to provide such as photographs.

[•] Any text the client wants to write (preferably in electronic format which will allow you to copy
	and paste it rather than re-type it).

========================================================================================================

========================================================================================================
I generally avoid starting work on a site until the client has provided most of these things (otherwise you
can spend lots of time on a project only to end up waiting a long time for the client to finish the copy or
get some photographs taken).
