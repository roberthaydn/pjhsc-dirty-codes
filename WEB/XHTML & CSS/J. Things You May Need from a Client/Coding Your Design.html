Coding Your Design
============================================================================
In order to position elements on the page, we will be taking them out of normal flow. In particular, we
will be using.

The XHTML <div> element to group elements of our XHTML page into blocks or chunks
The CSS float property to position these < div > elements to the left or the right of the page
The CSS width property to set how wide the boxes should be (if you do not set a width property on a floated element, it takes up the full width of the pageâ€”just as it would in normal flow)
The CSS margin property to separate blocks from each other.
