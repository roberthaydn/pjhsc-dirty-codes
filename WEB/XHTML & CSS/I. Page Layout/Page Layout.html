Understanding the Site’s Audience
===========================================================================================
Who? Who will visit the site?
Why? Why have they come to your site? They probably want to achieve something. 
What? What sort of information do you think they would expect to find in order to satisfy their reason for coming to the site?
How often? How often can you realistically expect them to visit?
===========================================================================================
>>> Who Will Visit the Site? 

Throughout the design process, you must keep one thing in mind: You need to design the page for the
target audience of the site — not just yourself or the site owner.

Some of the following questions will help you define your target audience.
 [•] What is the age range of your target audience?
 [•] Will your site appeal more to men or women?
 [•] Which country do your visitors live in?
 [•] Do they live in an urban area or rural area?
 [•] What is the income level of the visitors?
 [•] What level of education do they have?
 [•] What is their marital or family status?
 [•] What is their occupation?
 [•] How many hours do they work per week?
 [•] How often do they use the Web?
 [•] If your site is aimed at a business:
 [•] What is the size of the company?
 [•] What is the size of the department?
 [•] What is the position on individuals in the company using the site?
 [•] Will these individuals be using the item or information themselves?
 [•] How large is the budget they control?

>>> Why Have They Visited Your Site?
While some people may happen across your site because they ’ re browsing and see a link that they think
is interesting, the majority of visitors arrive at your site for a reason. Your design should be influenced
by the goals of users, and therefore you should try and list all the goals that people might have in mind
when visiting the site.

>>> What Does a Visitor Need to Achieve a Goal?
    you need to work out what you need to offer in order to help them achieve their goal quickly and effectively. 

>>> How Often Will People Want to Visit?
	There is a very simple reason for asking this: Some sites should change more often than others. If your
	site is about something that people do not need to keep coming back for, why spend a lot of time and
	money regularly adding new content to the site? For example, if you provide a service that people rarely
	use (from wedding services to double glazing), I would hope that the same person would not need to
	keep coming back to your site.

	Conversely, if visitors have the potential to regularly return to the site, you will need to consider
	updating the content regularly so that they want to keep coming back

>>> Things You Want the Site to Do
	By now you should have an idea of who is coming to your site, why they are coming, what they need in
	order to satisfy their reason for visiting, and when they might come back. This will probably be quite a
	long list already, but there is one more thing you need to add to it: information that the site owner wants
	on the site, but which might not be part of the list already.

	This may include things that users could find useful when they arrive on the site (even though they may
	not have come for this reason), such as the ability to sign up for e - mail updates, subscribe to an RSS feed,
	search the site, enter a competition, or find out about your new upcoming product. It may also include
	information that is not really for the user (such as advertising).

	Finally, if your list does not yet include such things, don ’ t forget that you will want to include your logo
	or branding to most pages. You should also remember some boring yet necessary features such as a
	copyright notice, terms and conditions, and a privacy policy (the latter is important if you collect
	information about users or use a technology known ascookies for storing information on the user ’ s
	computer).

>>> Prioritizing Information	
	Now that you have a list of what your visitors want to achieve and what the site owner wants to achieve,
	you should start to prioritize that information. You have your fictional friends to help you work out
	which tasks are most important. If one of them has not already asked about a piece of information, or it
	will not help this person achieve a goal, itmay be lower priority.

	I have come across plenty of site owners who want to push messages that are not aligned with what the
	majority of visitors want to find out. With so many sites on the Web, if your site does not fulfill your
	visitor s’ requirements quickly and easily they will go elsewhere. I ’ m not saying you should ignore
	messages that the site owner wants featured, just that the needs of the visitors should usually be
	considered of paramount importance.

	At this point you might also look at other sites that address a similar topic — the competition — and
	look at what they do and don ’ t do well and whether these sites meet the needs of the people you expect
	to visit your site. One of the key points to think about here is what you can do differently or better —
	something that makes you look better than the competition (rather than just copying them).

>>> Identifying Key Elements for Each Page
	You should create the list of the key elements of each page before you even start
	thinking about where to position them, although it is very helpful if you have an
	idea of how much space each element will take.

>>> Page Size (and Screen Resolution)	
>>> Understanding Screen Sizes
>>> Deciding the Width of Your Page
	As a general rule you will not want users to scroll horizontally, from left to right to view information on a
	web page, so you should probably make the width of your page fit within a screen that is 1024 pixels wide.	
	
	The screen is 1024 pixels wide, your design should allow space for the window and scroll bars;
	somewhere between 960 and 980 pixels is a more common width.

>>> Deciding the Height of Your Page
	While you should avoid expecting visitors to scroll horizontally, you can safely expect visitors to scroll
	up and down the page vertically to find the information they are looking for. However, it is very
	important that, when the page loads, the visitor has a good idea of what kind of information will be on
	that page without having to scroll.

>>> Fixed-Width vs. Liquid Designs	
	Fixed-width designs - remain the same as you increase and shrink the size of the
						  browser window, whereas the liquid layouts like Figures 9-5 and 9-6 stretch to 
						  fill the entire width of the browser window.
	Fixed-width designs are commonly used where the designers want to retain control over exactly how the
	page looks. This is seen as particularly important when sites are heavily design-led (where the
	presentation of information on the site is particularly important) or when they feature a lot of text.	
	
	Liquid (Stretchy) Page
	In order to create a liquid layout that will stretch to fit the page, you specify proportions of a page using
	percentage values.	

	Here you can see how this effect can be created using a < div > element, which acts as
	a container for the page:
	==================================
	xhtml codes
	==================================
	<body>
	 <div id="page">
		CONTENT OF PAGE GOES HERE 
	 </div>
	</body> 
	==================================
	div#page {
		 width:80%;
		 padding:5%;
		 border:1px solid #666666;
		 font-family:arial, verdana, sans-serif;
		 font-size:12px;
 	}

===========================================================================================
Designing Pages
	Composition and Grids - is the placement or arrangement of visual elements. In order to arrange the various items that
							need to appear on a web page, many designers use agrid (a set of lines, which are sometimes shaded in)
							and arrange the items that need to appear on a page according to the grid.

	Sketching the Placement of Elements	- it is important that you focus just on making sure you include all of the 
										  information a visitor needs and every item the user can interact with in 
										  order to give it the necessary space. This process is referred to as creating a 
										  wire frame .			

===========================================================================================

Common Page Elements and Templates

Here are some terms often used to describe parts of pages:

Headers -> The top part of the page on any site. In many cases the header will feature the logo and
		   the primary navigation, which should be consistent across the entire site.

Footers -> Appear on the bottom of every page. They often contain things like copyright notices,
		   privacy policy, and terms and conditions. Again, they should usually be consistent across the
		   entire site. Again, they should usually be consistent across the entire site.

Body and content -> Describe the main part of the page between the header and footer where the
					content sits.

Templates -> Describe a layout for several pages that look the same but contain different
			information. For example, an e-commerce site tends to use the same template to display each of
			its products, which helps the user know where to find things like the price, dimensions, and
			description of each product.	

===========================================================================================
Grouping Elements - Grouping or chunking items together helps reduce the number of elements that the user sees on the page.

The following methods help make it clear to a user that several elements of a page are related:
	Location: Making sure that similar elements of the design are near to each other
	Color: Using blocks of background color to make it clear which items relate to each other
	Borders and padding: Creating a gap between one group of elements and other items on the
						 page to indicate which are grouped together
	Headings: Giving related items a header, so that people know what will be in the block of
			  information without necessarily reading each item in the block	
	Styles: Using similar buttons for navigation items
===========================================================================================
creating a Visual Hierarchy and Prioritizing Information on a Page

It is important to create avisual hierarchy in any design so that the most important 
item on the page is most prominent. 

1. To take up more space.
2. Have more space between them and other items.		
3. Use larger headings.
==
While it is tempting to put a lot of information on each page, if the screen is too cluttered it will be
harder for the user to achieve the goal he or she had in mind when coming to your site. Therefore it is
important to prioritize the information that appears on each page.

Branding/logo: The company name or logo should appear on the same place in each page; it is
			   commonly placed in the top left or top centered.

Primary navigation: A link to the homepage and the main sections of the site — note that the
                    homepage should almost always be the first item of navigation.

Any secondary navigation: If the sections of the site are further divided into subsections, when
                          you are in those sections you should be able to see enough of the navigation to tell that the
                          subsections exist (although you do not need to be able to see all options).

Page headings: With the exception of the homepage, every page should have a title or heading
               that quickly lets the user know what that page is about.

Content: Ideally you want enough of the content of the page to be above the fold so that the
         users know whether this page is going to be relevant to them and, you hope, gets them
         involved with the content of the page before they have to start scrolling.

Search: A way for users to search for the information they want if they do not see it immediately.
===========================================================================================
How Visitors Look at a Page

It is important to acknowledge that, no matter how much you would like your visitors to read every
page on your site, and no matter how well written it is, they will not. Visitors scan web pages to find out
whether that page is relevant to them.

Text should be concise in particular headings. -> Where possible, the first couple of words in a
												  heading or paragraph should describe the content the user would discover if he or she read on.
												  Another renowned usability expert, Steve Krug, recommends that, when devising a web page,
												  users look at the copy they started with and divide it in half. Then they should halve it again
												  because most sites are far too wordy. By his own admission, the second one is an exaggeration,
                                                  but his point is that most sites can get their message across in far fewer words if they really try.

Use subheadings to split up text. -> If you have a lot of text, you should split it up with
									 descriptive subheadings. Again make sure the first couple of 
									 words of the heading give the reader information about 
									 the content of the following text.

Use bolding and other styles. -> Highlight keywords to help users scan pages for key terms,
								 indicating whether the page is relevant to them.

Make links descriptive. -> Where you have text links, ensure that the text describes what people
                           will see if they click on the link. Links should also stand out from surrounding text (because
                           many people will scan for links).

Stimulate users with visuals. -> A lot of web users are attracted to (and navigate by) images. So if
                                 you have a list of articles or products on your site, thumbnails will help turn lists into something
                                 more visual and stimulating, in turn encouraging users to follow those links.
