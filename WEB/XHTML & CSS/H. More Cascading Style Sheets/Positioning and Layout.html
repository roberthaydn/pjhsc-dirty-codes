The position Property
==
The position property -> allows you to specify how you want to control the position for a box
=============================================================================================================================
Value               |           Meaning
=============================================================================================================================
static  			| This is the same as normal flow, and is the default, so you will rarely (if ever) see it specified.
relative 			| The position of the box can be offset from where it would be if it were left in normal flow.
absolute 			| The box is positioned exactly using x and y coordinates from the top-left corner of the containing element.
fixed  				| The position is calculated from the top-left corner of a browser window and does not change position if the user scrolls the window.

Box Offset Properties
=============================================================================================================================
As you'll see in the coming sections, when box	position: relative;
	top:100px;es have aposition property whose value is relative,
absolute , orfixed , they will also usebox offset properties to indicate where these boxes should be
positioned. The table that follows lists thebox offset properties.
=============================================================================================================================
Property  Meaning
==================================================================================================
top     | Offset position from the top of the containing element
left    | Offset position from the left of the containing element
bottom  | Offset position from the bottom of the containing element
right   | Offset position from the right of the containing element
==================================================================================================
Each can take a value of a length, a percentage, or auto . Relative units, including percentages, are
calculated with respect to the containing boxes ’ dimensions or properties.

Relative Positioning
The value of the box offsets is most commonly given in pixels or a percentage.

	 border-width:2px;

	 position:relative;
	 left: 40px;
	 top: -110px;

<h3>Relative Positioning</h3>
<p class="a">Relative positioning allows you to move a box in relation to where it would appear in normal flow. For
example, you might move a box 30 pixels down from where it would appear in normal flow.</p>

<p class="b">Relative positioning allows you to move a box in relation to where it would appear in normal flow. For
example, you might move a box 30 pixels down from where it would appear in normal flow.</p>

Absolute Positioning
Absolute positioning takes an element out of normal flow, allowing you to fix its position. You can
specify that an element ’ s content should be absolutely positioned by giving it theposition property
with a value ofabsolute ; then you use the box offset properties to position it where you want.

Fixed Positioning
The final value you need to be aware of for theposition property is the valuefixed . This value
specifies that the content of the element should not only be completely removed from normal flow, but
also that the box should not move when users scroll up or down a page.
