The :focus and :active Pseudo - Classes
=========================================================================================================
When an element gains focus, browsers tend to give it a slightly different appearance. The:focus
pseudo - class allows you to associate extra rules with an element when it gains focus to make it more
pronounced. Meanwhile the:active pseudo - class allows you to associate further styles with elements
when they are activated â€” such as when a user clicks a link.

<style type="text/css">
input {
 border:none;
 background-color:#dddddd;
 height:1.999em;
}
input:focus {background-color:yellow;}	
</style>

The :before and :after Pseudo-Elements
The :before and:after pseudo-elements work to a limited degree in IE7 or higher and have good
support in Firefox.
The:before and :after pseudo-elements enable you to add text before or after each instance of an
element defined in a selector. 

-->
<style type="text/css">
	p.abstract:after {content: "You need to register to read the full article.";color:#ff0000;}
	/* you can use either after or before. */
</style>
<h3>The :before and :after Pseudo-Elements</h3>

<p class="abstract">Here you can see that the pseudo- element:after is used at the end of the selector. Then, inside the
declaration, you can see thecontent property; the text in quotes will be added to the end of the element.
Thecontent property can add a number of types of content to the document, not just text, and you will
see these in the next section.</p>
