<!-- Floating Using the float Property
===============================================================================================================
The float property allows you to take an element out of normal flow and place it as far to the left or
right of a containing box as possible.

Anything else that lives in the containing element will flow around the element that is associated with
thefloat property (just like text and other elements can flow around an image).

Whenever you specify afloat property on an element, you must also set awidth property indicating
the width that the box should take up; otherwise, it will automatically take up 100 percent of the width
of the containing box, leaving no space for things to flow around it and therefore making it appear just
like a plain block- level element.

To indicate that you want a box floated either to the left or the right of the containing box, you set the
float property, which can take one of the values listed in the table that follows.

===============================================================================================================
Value            |         Purpose
===============================================================================================================
left             |   The box is floated to the left of the containing element and the content of the containing element will flow to the right of it.
right            |   The box is floated to the right of the containing element and the content of the containing element will flow to the left of it.
none             |   The box is not floated and remains where it would have been positioned in normal flow.
inherit          |   The box takes the same property as its containing element.

 normal flow and appear on the right of the page. </p>

 <p> This is where the story starts and it will appear at the top of the

 article or story. In this example, the pull quote gets moved across to the
