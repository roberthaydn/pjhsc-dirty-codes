Additional Rules
=======================================================================================================
@import imports another style sheet into the current style sheet.
!important indicates that some rules should take precedence to others.
@charset indicates the character set the style sheet uses.
=======================================================================================================
@import -> The@import rule allows you to import styles from another style sheet. It should appear right at the start
of the style sheet before any of the rules, and its value is a URL.

<style Type="text/css">
/* @import "codeStyles.css"; */ 
@import url("codeStyles.css");
body {
	background-color:#ffffff;
	font-family:arial, verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;
}
h1 {
	font-size:24pt;
}

</style>

<h1>Example Using Imported Styles</h1>
<p>The style sheet for this document used the @import rule to import styles from another style sheet The syntax is:</p>
<p class="syntax">@import "codeStyles.css"</p><hr>

=======================================================================================================
!important 
!important -> When there is a chance that two style - sheet rules might conflict with each other, you can use
the!important rule to indicate that this particular rule should take precedence over others. 

This can be helpful if you are developing modular style sheets and you want to ensure that a rule in the
included style sheets takes precedence over any conflicting rules in the style sheet containing the
@import rule (which would otherwise have taken precedence).

An !important declaration provides a way for a stylesheet author to give a CSS value more weight than it naturally has.

<h3>The @charset Rule</h3>
<p>If you are writing your style sheet using a character set that features characters other than the basic Latin
characters (the ASCII or ISO - 8859 - 1 character sets), you might want to set the@charset rule at the top of
your style sheet to indicate what character set the style sheet is written in.</p>

<p>The@charset rule must be written right at the beginning of the style sheet without even a space before
it. The value is held in quotes and should be one of the language codes specified in Appendix G.
@charset "iso-8859-1"</p>
