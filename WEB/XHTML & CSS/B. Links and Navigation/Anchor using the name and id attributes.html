<p>If you take a look at Figure 2 - 8, you can see how the page has several links to the sections of the page;
and in Figure 2 - 9, you can see what happens when the user clicks on the second link and is taken directly
to that section of the page. You can see the full code for this example in the download code for this
chapter, available from the Wrox web site; the file isch02_eg06.html .
 It is important for destination anchors to always have some content; otherwise some browsers will not
