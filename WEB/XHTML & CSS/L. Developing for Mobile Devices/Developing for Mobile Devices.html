Context: What Is the Mobile User Doing?
=======================================================================================================
Mobile devices are being used on the move, often in a hurry, and sometimes one - handed. The result is
that when mobile phones are used to access the Web, they are often used to achieve very different things
than the same user might want to achieve in front of a desktop computer.
=======================================================================================================
Relationship: How Do Users Treat Their Mobile Phones?
=======================================================================================================
It is also worth comparing the relationship that people have with their mobile phones compared with
desktop computers. It is far more common for people to have their own mobile phones whereas desktop
computers are often shared between members of a family, or used at work and schools. This means that
people have a more personal relationship with their mobile phones. It also means that it is possible to
more accurately uniquely identify users and personalize services to them.
=======================================================================================================
=======================================================================================================
Capabilities: How Do Features of Mobiles Compare with Desktop PCs?
=======================================================================================================
=======================================================================================================
Allow for location specific services: Because they can use triangulation or (where installed)
GPS to identify location of users.
===
Have a built-in payment system: Whether on contract or a pay-as-you-go scheme, the payment
is integrated more than a desktop computer where a user must enter credit card information or
set up an account with a service such as PayPal. The payment system is also available to those
who are not old enough to have debit and credit cards. It has also been suggested that mobile
phone owners are more used to (and willing to) pay for services accessed via their mobile than
they are to pay for services accessed via a desktop computer.
===
Have a built-in camera: Only a handful of desktop machines will have a camera built in,
and those that do are still used in a desk-based setting (rather than being carried around all
the time).
===
Are integrated with voice data: Because they are phones as well, and although services such as
Skype allow phone calls to be made through a computer, it is not inherent in the platform.
Have other features: Such as SMS and MMS, which some users (particularly in Europe)
use often.
===
Slower connection speeds: The connection speeds of mobile phones consistently trail behind
those offered by broadband connections.
===
Connection can be intermittent: As users move about, for example when traveling in more
isolated rural areas, or when going through tunnels in cities, their connection can be cut.
===
Screen are usually smaller: Because screens are small, it is not possible for users to scan as
much information to find out what they are looking for.
===
Input devices are harder to use: Although many mobile users are adept at using their mobile
phones, they are unlikely to achieve the same speed and accuracy of data input that they would
achieve with a keyboard and mouse.
===
Less control over appearance: Several phones will remove your choice of font, size of text, and
background images to show them in a manner they see fit for the device.
=======================================================================================================
How to Approach Mobile Development
=======================================================================================================
Just have one main web site (no separate mobile site)
Provide a different view of the content on your site to those with mobile phones
Create an entirely new site for mobile users
=======================================================================================================
Provide an Alternative View of Your Site
=======================================================================================================
The first approach is to add a second style sheet to the same pages, so that mobile devices can use a
separate set of CSS rules to control how the pages appear to them:
=====
 <link href="mobile.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="handheld"/>
=====
This can help you use a different layout, change the dimensions of the page, and attempt to control
colors and sizes of fonts.
=====
Unfortunately, not all phones know to take this version of the style sheet, and those that do still have to
download a page that is the same file size as the pages created for desktop computers (which means that
they may take a long time to download).
=====
 I have seen style sheets for handheld devices that try to hide parts of the page (setting the CSSdisplay
property on those elements tonone ), which has the advantage that it makes the interface simpler,
although it does not make the file size smaller.
=====
The second approach is to use a different set of templates when someone arrives at your site via a mobile
device. Rather than just using a new style sheet, some companies will use the same content, but design
new pages to hold the information.
====
This approach allows a lot more flexibility because you can change the order in which items appear. You
can also entirely remove some parts of the page (such as advertisements and secondary navigation), and
therefore reduce bandwidth needed to load the pages.
====
Still, both of these methods still fail to address the context in which the phone is being used.
=======================================================================================================
Create a Separate Mobile-Optimized with Its Own Content
=======================================================================================================
If you have the resources available, users will often benefit from a site being specifically designed for use
on a mobile phone. It allows you to address the requirements of users who are on the go (which are often
different from those of a desktop PC user) and to understand the context in which visitors to your site
use these devices.
=======================================================================================================
Languages for Creating Mobile Web Sites
===
Technically speaking, they tend to support one of two subsets of XHTML known as XHTML - Mobile
Profile and XHTML Basic. A good rule of thumb, however, is just to stick to the most common XHTML
features and then most phones will be able to handle it. Here is the DOCTYPE declaration for XHTML -
 Mobile Profile:
===
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-//WAPFORUM//DTD XHTML Mobile 1.0//EN"
 “http://www.wapforum.org/DTD/xhtml-mobile10.dtd" >
===
While there is not enough space in this book to cover all the differences between XHTML - MP and
XHTML, there are several resources on the Web that can help you with this, such as the Openwave
developer’ s reference:

=======================================================================================================
Design Tips
===
Content
===
 [•] Use clear concise language. Content should be available in small bite - size chunks that are easy to digest.

 [•] Use semantic markup, such as headings in <hn> elements, paragraphs in <p> elements, and so on.

 [•] User fewer images and graphics to save on download speeds.

 [•] Consider using the title of pages to indicate the action that a user should take.
===
Color
===
 [•] Ensure that there is sufficient contrast in your designs.

 [•] Avoid using backgrounds.
===
Navigation
===
[•] Consider having the main navigation on the homepage only (with a link back to the homepage
	on every other page), or if you do have a navigation bar at the top of every page, have the
	minimum number of options you can.

[•] At the end of each page have home and back links, but don ’ t repeat the links that appear on the
	bottom of the site used by desktop visitors (such asabout, help , andfaq ).
===
Links
===
[•] Stick to black text and blue links, and avoid using other colors for links. Remember that many
 	mobile phones are used outside where screens can be harder to read.

[•] Make it clear which link is active because it is harder to get the right link.

[•] For phones, while iPhone and the Mobile Opera browser automatically determine phone
 	numbers, you can put phone numbers in <a> tags, with thehref attribute starting with tel:

 	<a href="tel:+44 (0) 208 208 2080" > +44 (0) 208 208 2080 </a>	
===
Forms
===
Consider using links instead of form controls.

 [•] Do not mask passwords. The use of dots or asterisks on password inputs was to prevent people
	 looking over the shoulder of the user from seeing the password entered; this is not so much of
	 an issue on mobile devices (and it is easier to make mistakes when typing on a mobile device).

[•] If you have fields that only allow numbers (such as quantity fields), only allow people to enter
	numbers into these form fields (this technique is sometimes known as an input mask).

[•] Avoid logins unless absolutely necessary.

============
Testing
============

 With the number of mobile devices available today, no one would expect you to test a mobile site on
every available phone. Some developers choose to run a few phones with varying capabilities (switching
one SIM card between them), but you can always ask friends to see if they can access a site for you and
show you what it looks like on their phones.

 You can also use the following emulators, which mimic the abilities of phones:

 [•] dotMobi emulator — simulates Sony Ericsson K750 and Nokia N70 (http://mtld.mobi/emulator.php)
 [•] Opera Mini Simulator ( www.operamini.com/ )
 [•] Nokia Mobile Browser Simulator ( www.forum.nokia.com/)
 [•] Openwave phone simulator (http://developer.openwave.com/dvl/tools_and_sdk/phone_simulator/)
 [•] iPhoney (www.marketcircle.com/iphoney/ )
 [•] Blackberry (http://na.blackberry.com/eng/developers/resources/simulators.jsp )
