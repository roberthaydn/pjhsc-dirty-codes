Introducing the Box Model

The Box Model is a very important concept in CSS because it determines how elements are positioned
within the browser window. It gets its name because CSS treats every element as if it were in a box.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Property Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
border  -- Even if you cannot see it, every box has a border. This separates the edge of one From other surrounding boxes. 
margin  -- The margin is the distance between the border of a box and the box next to it.
padding -- This padding is the space between the content of the box and its border.

 <h1>Thinking Inside the Box</h1>
	 <p class="description">When you are styling a web page with CSS you
	 must start to think in terms of <b>boxes</b>.</p>

	 <p>Each element is treated as if it generates a new box. Each box can have
	 new rules associated with it.</p>

	 <img src="Img.jpg" alt="How CSS treats a box"/>

	 <p>As you can see from the diagram above, each box has a <b>border</b>.
	 Between the content and the border you can have <b>padding</b>, and
	 outside of the border you can have a <b>margin</b> to separate this box
	 from any neighboring boxes.</p>
