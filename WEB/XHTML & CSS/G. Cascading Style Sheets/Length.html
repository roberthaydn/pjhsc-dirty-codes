Lengths

You have already seen that the values of some CSS properties are given as lengths (such as the size of
fonts, height of lines of text, and gaps between words and letters), and you will come across more
properties whose values are expressed as lengths later in the chapter. So, let’s take a moment to look at
the three ways lengths can be specified in CSS:

>> Relative units
>> Absolute units
>> Percentages

===============================================================================================================
Relative Units
There are three types of relative units: pixels, which relate to the resolution of the screen, and em’s and 
ex’s both of which relate to the size of fonts.
----
px - The pixel, referred to in code aspx, is by far the most commonly used unit of length in CSS. A pixel is the
smallest unit of resolution on a screen and if you look very closely at your screen you might just be able
to see the square dots that are the pixels.
----
em - Anem is equivalent to the height of the current font, and because the size of fonts can vary throughout a
document, the height of the em unit can be different in different parts of the document.

em unit is most commonly used for measurements of elements that contain text and
for controlling spacing between text. (for example it can be used in the line-height property to set the
gaps between lines of text in relation to their height).
----
ex
The ex should be the height of a lowercase x.

Absolute Units
Generally speaking, absolute units are used far less than relative units.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Unit    --   Full Name                                              --
----------------------------------------------------------------------
pt      -- A point                                                  --  
pc      -- A pica                                                   --
in      -- An inch                                                  --
cm      -- A centimeter                                             --
mm      -- A millimeter                                             --
----------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================================================
Percentages
Percentages - give a value in relation to another value. For example, if your page only contained two
paragraphs, and you wanted each to take up half of the width of the browser, then the paragraphs might
be given awidth property with a value of 50%. However, if the <p> element were inside another element
that you knew was 500 pixels wide, they would take up 50 percent of the width of that containing
element (or 250 pixels) each.
