<style type="text/css">
 div {
 max-height:75px;
 max-width:250px;
 padding:5px;
 margin:10px;
 border:1px solid #000000;
 float:left;
}

 div.one {
 	
 }
 div.two {
 	overflow:scroll;

</style>

<div class="one">Take a look at the following example, where the width of two < div > elements has been controlled by the
max - height andmax - width properties so that the content of the < div > elements does not fit in the box.
For the first element, I have set theoverflow property to have a value ofhidden and the second to
have a value ofscroll</div> 

<div class="two">Take a look at the following example, where the width of two < div > elements has been controlled by the
max - height andmax - width properties so that the content of the < div > elements does not fit in the box.
