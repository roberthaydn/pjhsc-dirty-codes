Typography
=========================================================

 [•] Line length
 [•] Relationship between sizes of letters
 [•] Gaps between lines
 [•] Spaces between letters and words
 [•] Careful chunking
 [•] Contrast
 [•] Choice of fonts

===
Legible: Text is legible if it is recognizable; for example, when a font gets too small it may no longer be legible.
===
Readable: Text is readable if it is comfortable to read it for many minutes (without strain or difficulty).
===
Line Length — A Measure
A measure is the name typographers give to the number of characters in a single line of text. 
 
 [•] body text is considered to be 50-60 characters. or 45 and 75 characters.
 [•] narrow column, your measure should be less — around 30 to 50 characters.

Font Sizes
8pt 9pt 10pt 11pt 12pt 14pt 18pt 24pt 36pt 48pt 60pt 72pt

	body {font-size: 12px;}
	h1 {font-size: 24px;}
	h2 {font-size: 18px;}
	h3 {font-size: 16px;}
	h4 {font-size: 14px;}
=======================================================
using PERCENTAGE
=======================================================
body {font-size: 75%;} /* 16 x .075 = 12 */
h1 {font-size: 200%;}  /* 12 x 2 = 24 */
h2 {font-size: 150%;}  /* 12 x 1.5 = 18 */
h3 {font-size: 133%;}  /* 12 x 1.333 = 16 */
h4 {font-size: 116%;}  /* 12 x 1.16 = 14 */
=======================================================
using EM
=======================================================
body {font-size: 100%;}  /* ensure IE scales correctly */
p {font-size: 0.75em;}   /* 16 x 0.75 = 12 */
h1 {font-size: 1.5em;}   /* 16 x 1.5 = 24 */
h2 {font-size: 1.3em;}   /* 16 x 1.125 = 18 */
h3 {font-size: 0.875em;} /* 16 x 0.875 = 14 */

p {
	font-size:1px;
	font-size:1em;
	font-size:1%;
	font-size:1rem;
}

Choosing Fonts
=======================================================
Sans-serif:  Arial, Helvetica, Verdana
Serif:       Times, Times New Roman, Georgia
Monospace:   Courier, Courier New
=======================================================
Line Height — Leading
=======================================================
is the vertical space between lines of text. Text sits on a baseline, and the
height of letters such as a, e, and x are collectively known as the x height. The parts of letters that drop.
(1.5 em is a good starting point.)

Space Between Letters —Tracking
=======================================================
Tracking is the term typographers use to describe the space between letters. You can control the space
between letters using theletter - spacing property in CSS.

For paragraphs of text in sentence case (where capitalization is the same as a normal sentence), you
should not need to change the spacing between letters. (In fact, doing so may harm legibility.)

This feature can, however, be particularly helpful when dealing with headings or text that is
all uppercase. This is because text in capital letters is harder to read than text in sentence case;
in such cases giving the letter - spacing property a value of 0.1em can help improve legibility
(ch10_eg08.html).

ex. h1.header_spacing { letter-spacing:0.1em; }
=======================================================
White Space
=======================================================
White space, ornegative space , is the name given to the space between elements on a page, but it does not
have to be white; it just signifies the gaps between items on the page.

[•] Macro white space is the space between the large elements on the page.
[•] Micro white space is the amount of space between things such as text, headings, and list items.
=======================================================
Chunking
=======================================================
[•] Chunking, or grouping items together, is a very helpful tool in design. 
[•] uses lines to indicate where groups of information sit together.
=======================================================
Contrast
=======================================================
It is very important to have enough contrast between any type and the background it is sitting on. It is not
only people with color blindness and other visual impairments who suffer when there ’ s a lack of contrast.
Those with a bad monitor, or sunlight on their screens, may have more difficulty reading the content.

very good tool for checking contrast: www.snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html
