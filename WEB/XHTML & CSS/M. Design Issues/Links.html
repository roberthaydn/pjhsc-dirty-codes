Text Links
=======================================
By default, text links tend to be blue and underlined. Some experts on usability suggest that all links
should be left to their default appearance. However, from your experience of the Web, you probably
know that using a color that ’ s clearly different from the main text makes it easy enough for users to tell
what text makes up a link.

You have just seen an example of how to change the color and appearance of links, and also how to
change their state when someone hovers a mouse over the link.

When you use CSS to specify the color of links, the browser will not change the color of visited links
anymore. To do this, you need to use the:visited pseudo class.

ex.
a {font-weight:bold; color:#ff0000; text-decoration:none;}
a:hover {color:#FF9900; text-decoration:underline; background-color:#f9f0f0;}
a:visited {color:#990000;}

=======================================
Images as Links
=======================================
Images are often used as links in menus, advertisements, photos to click on, graphical icons, and so on.
Whenever you use an image as a link you should use two attributes on the image:

alt = ”description of image or text on image ”: Use this to tell users who cannot see
the image what the image is or what it says.

title= ”where the link will take the user”: Use this to show users a tooltip that says
where the link will take them; this is also used by screen readers.

If you do not use CSS to control the border of images that are links (and set them to“ no
border ” ), you should also add the border attribute:border=”0”. If you don’t use CSS to
control borders or this attribute, you will get a border around the image in many browsers,
which can look unsightly.
