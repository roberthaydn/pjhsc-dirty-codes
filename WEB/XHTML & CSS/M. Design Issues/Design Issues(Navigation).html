Navigation
=================================================================
A user will usually navigate your site in one of three ways:
===	
[•] Using a menu that you provide
[•] Browsing through links provided in the middle of text and other parts of the page than the menu
[•] Searching for relevant items of information
=================================================================
Menus
=================================================================
[•] Menus should be concise.
	• Limit the number of options you have on the menu to no more than eight items .
 	• Choose single, descriptive words for each link.

[•] Menus should have clear labels.
	• The labels on any navigation should use language that the visitor will understand (not jargon).

[•] Menus should focus on what visitors want to achieve.
	• It is very important for any site to focus on what the visitor wants to achieve.

[•] Menus do not need to contain every link.
	• The main menu of your site should only reflect the sections or content of the site.
	  Links to functions like those that follow can be kept separate:
		-> Login and register
		-> Shopping baskets and checkouts

[•] Menus should provide context.
	Color: To show the current page, either changing the text or background.
	Tabs: not necessary to use.
	Underlining: For the current option as shown in the Adaptive Path web site.

[•] Menus should be interactive.
	• It is important that menu items are clearly separate from other content and that visitors know they can be clicked on.

[•] Menus should be consistent.
	• The more pages a site contains, the more navigation items you are going to require. As soon as you have
	 to introduce submenus, the navigation becomes more complicated and will vary from page to page. It is
	 very important that the primary navigation remains consistent across all pages.

[•] If you use icons, add the text, too.
