<!-- 
The section Element

The <section> element is used to represent a group of related content. This is similar to the purpose of an <article> element with the main difference being that the content within a <section> element doesn’t necessarily need to make sense out of the context of the page.

It’s advisable to use a heading element (<h1> – <h6>) to define the topic for the section.

Using this blog post as an example, you could have <section> elements that represent each of the individual parts within the post.

<!--
Here we’ve used an <article> element to represent the post as a whole, and then multiple <section> elements to represent each of the sub-topics discussed in the post.

If you just need to group content together for styling purposes you should use a <div> element rather than a <section>.
