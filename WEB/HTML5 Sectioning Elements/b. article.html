<!-- 
The article Element

The <article> element should contain a piece of self-contained content that could be distributed outside the context of the page. This includes things like news articles, blog posts, or user comments.
-->
<article>
  <header>
    <h1>Blog Post Title</h1>
    <p>Posted 13th February 2014</p>
  </header>
  <p>
    ...
  </p>
</article>
<!-- 
You can nest <article> elements within one another. In this case it’s implied that the nested elements are related to the outer <article> element.

<!-- 
In this example we’ve used <article> elements to mark up the blog post, and each of the comments. This nesting pattern implies that the comments are related to the topic of the main blog post.
