<!-- 
The header Element

The <header> element is used to represent the introductory content to an article or web page. This will usually contain a heading element as well as some metadata that’s relevant to the content, such as the post date of a news article for example. It could also contain a table of contents (within a <nav> element) for a longer document.

A <header> element will be associated with the nearest sectioning element, usually it’s direct parent in the page structure.
