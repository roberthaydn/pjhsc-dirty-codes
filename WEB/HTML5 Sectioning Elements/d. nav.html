<!-- 
The nav Element

The <nav> element is used to mark up a collection of links to external pages or sections within the current page. As well as being used for the main website navigation, the <nav> element is also a good fit for things like a table of contents, or a blogroll.
-->

<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#chapter-one">Chapter One</a>
    <li><a href="#chapter-two">Chapter Two</a>
    <li><a href="#chapter-three">Chapter Three</a>
  </ul>
</nav>

<!--
Marking up your links within a list will often make your navigation easier to use, however this is not a requirement when using a <nav> element.
